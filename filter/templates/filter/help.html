          Filter for PyCantus is a web API that facilitates working with the filtration component of the <a href=>pycantus</a> 
          library — a library for working with data on Gregorian chant.
          <br><br>
          This API provides an interface that allows users to prepare their filtration setup using a form, 
          that also provides a list of potential values for individual fields based on the CantusCorpus v1.0 dataset.  
          Once the selection is complete, simply click on the "Submit setting to generate filtration file" button 
          and then download the YAML file describing the filter settings, which can then be loaded by the pycantus library.
          <br><br>
          If no value is entered in any of the fields, this is subsequently evaluated as "I don't care" 
          and records with any value (even with such field being empty for the record) in the given field are considered.
          <br><br>
          Below is a description of the individual fields that correspond to the data model in the <a href=>pycantus</a>
          library and that can be used to filter data, including sample values and links to other sources. <br>
          If you are new to Gregorian chant and its data, we strongly recommend reading through
           <a href="https://cantusdatabase.org/documents/">introductory manuals</a> completed for <a href="https://cantusdatabase.org/">Cantus Database</a>.

        Rubric in medieval liturgical manuscript with description of each part. <br><br>

        And here we present schema on Cantus Index ecosystem that is here used to provide wider image on the "old book" -> "web database" path
        of the data. 
        <img src="{% static 'img/chant-cataloguing-schema.png' %}" alt="" style="height: 600px;"><br>
        Chant data in the Cantus ecosystem. An expert reads a manuscript (today most often digitised), 
        identifies individual instances of chants, and creates their database records: most importantly, 
        assigning the Cantus ID to identify which unit of chant repertoire is on the page (pink process). 
        Expertise in the liturgy of the Latin church is needed, as one must correctly interpret abbreviated 
        notes in the manuscript --- rubrics --- in order to identify the liturgical position and function of the chant 
        (dark green process); together with the text of the chant, this then allows one to assign the correct Cantus ID. 
        A link to the source and page (folio) within the source is added (blue process). 
        Once a record with a Cantus ID is added to a database in the Cantus ecosystem, the Cantus Index hub 
        will retrieve the record, primarily via a search for all instances of the given 
        Cantus ID across all databases that are registered with Cantus Index (purple process; automatic).

            <div class="container mt-1 mb-1">
              Individual songs can be divided into two larger categories according to style, which are further
              divided into more specific genres. These are liturgical recitative and free
              composition. This division is based on an effort to find a balance between the comprehensibility
              of the sung text and the beauty and richness of the musical component. <br><br>
              The basic feature of liturgical recitative is the singing of the text on a single tone, with the ends of sentences 
              and other sections emphasized by a slight rise or fall in the melody. 
              This technique can be used for any text of any length. It is commonly used in prayers and readings, i.e., 
              texts that change almost every day of the year. <br><br>
              Psalmody, the method of performing psalm texts, constitutes a specific intermediate stage.
              Because these are texts recited with freely composed chants in close proximity (antiphons or responsories), 
              the recitation formulas have been perfected. In addition, there are a
              limited number of psalms, and they are all used during each week. <br><br>
              In contrast, it is typical for free composition that each text has its own melody of varying complexity. 
              As mentioned above, these are mainly antiphons (which form the boundaries of the psalms) and responsories 
              (which often delimit the readings - lessons), followed by hymns (songs with a strophic structure) 
              and invitatories (songs opening the night prayers of the office). After the early Middle Ages, sequences 
              and tropes (more free and varied genres) were added.<br><br>
              The Mass was expanded to include genres corresponding to its parts (e. g. Alleluia, Credo or Gloria).<br><br>
              Here is an overview of main genres of Office of Hours: <br>
